This repository contains all of the scripts necessary to run the software designed by us, Team 10, for the project entitled "Implementing a GRU based network to detect stock prices on FPGA"
The finalized product is contained in the GRU Folder and those scripts may be downloaded in order to run the software on your own device.
To prepare your device you must download the files contained within the folder, using and IDE of your choice for Python 3, you must then use the "pip install" tool to download all necessary libraries. These libraries are all in the head of each code, you IDE will also direct you to which libraries need to be installed. Once all libraries have been installed you may either use an IDE, SSH, or Terminal to begin the software.

In order to boot the software you must run the script entitled "GUI 4". 



All other scripts on this repository are versions made throughout the design process and may be incomplete versions and should not be used for running the user end product as they may not be compatible with the integrated system. They have been left here to demostrate the design steps taken throughout the project. 


We wish you happy stock trading!* - Team 10, Kevin S., Sean K, Xavier F.


*Predictions made by the system are not finanical advice, but is rather a tool to be used in the aid of stock analysis.
